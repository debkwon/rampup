#To parse a JSON string received by another application or generated within your existing application:

=begin
require 'json'

my_hash = JSON.parse('{"hello": "goodbye"}')
puts my_hash["hello"] => "goodbye"
Notice the extra quotes '' around the hash notation. Ruby expects the argument to be a string and canâ€™t convert objects like a hash or array.

Ruby converts your string into a hash
